#+TITLE: Concise Common Workflow Language (ccwl)

The Concise Common Workflow Language (ccwl) is a concise syntax to
express CWL workflows. It is implemented as an Embedded Domain
Specific Language (EDSL) in the Scheme programming language, a
minimalist dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages.

ccwl is a compiler to generate CWL workflows from concise descriptions
in ccwl. In the future, ccwl will also have a runtime whereby users
can interactively execute workflows while developing them.
