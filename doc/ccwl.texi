@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@abbr{CWL, Common Workflow Language} is an open standard for describing
analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and
scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments.

@abbr{ccwl, Concise Common Workflow Language} is a concise syntax to
express CWL workflows. It is implemented as an @abbr{EDSL, Embedded
Domain Specific Language} in the Scheme programming language, a
minimalist dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages.

ccwl is a compiler to generate CWL workflows from concise descriptions
in ccwl. In the future, ccwl will also have a runtime whereby users can
interactively execute workflows while developing them.
