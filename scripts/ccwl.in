;;; Commentary:

;; This script compiles a CCWL workflow to CWL.

;;; Code:

(use-modules (ice-9 match)
             (ccwl ccwl)
             (ccwl yaml))

(match (command-line)
  ((_ "compile" input-file)
   ;; FIXME: Compiling ccwl files fails since the workflow macro is
   ;; unable to access command definitions.
   (set! %load-should-auto-compile #f)
   (scm->yaml (load (canonicalize-path input-file))
              (current-output-port)))
  ((program _ ...)
   (format (current-error-port)
           "Usage: ~a compile input-file~%"
           program)
   (exit #f)))
