;;; Commentary:

;; This script compiles a CCWL workflow to CWL.

;;; Code:

             (ice-9 match)
             (ccwl ccwl)
             (ccwl cwl))

  (error "Invalid option" name))

    ((_ "compile" args ...)
     (let* ((args (args-fold args
                             '()
                             invalid-option
                             (lambda (arg result)
